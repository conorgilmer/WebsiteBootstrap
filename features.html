        John Ryan (1925 - 1992) was an Irish artist, broadcaster, publisher, critic, editor, patron and publican.
Ryan was a well-known man of letters, artist and a key figure in bohemian Dublin of the 1940s & 50s. He was a friend and benefactor to a number of struggling artists and writers in the post-war era, such as Patrick Kavanagh, Anthony Cronin and Brendan Behan. It was often Ryan who brought these disparate characters together, particularly with his founding of Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art. He purchased The Bailey pub in 1957, which became a literary institution. For some he was a sort of 'Dublin prince'.[1] He was involved in numerous literary events and happenings and, with Brian O'Nolan, organised the first ever Bloomsday.
